# Tob

### Tob is a discord bot that reverses 1/69 messages.

## Features
- Channel/Server wide toggle: Use `|server add` to enable tob serverwide, or `|channel add` to enable tob in a particular channel. This will allow tob to reverse messages in those channels.
- media.discordapp.net and twitter.com url replacement: replaces these urls for better embed solutions on pc and mobile, for certain file types
- Reacts to certain keywords
- Self promotion (of my youtube channel) ðŸ˜Ž
- Bruhngus

## Running the bot
You will need to setup a discord bot, a twitter application, and get the correct tokens from those setup as environment variables (refer to `src/main.py` for the environment variables needed).

(For access to the running instance of the bot, please DM me on discord at `Sol_InvictusXLII#1306`).

You will also need a python 3.8 or higher installation.
